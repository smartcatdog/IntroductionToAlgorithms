# IntroductionToAlgorithms
This project is the reading notes for the 4th Introduction to Algorithms, including some exercises
solution solved by self or referenced by leetcode. In each chapter, I try my best to solve the
exercises and present different solutions below the chapter of the 4th Introduction to Algorithms
via Java/Scala/Python.
